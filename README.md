# Wiki Site
<a name="Wiki"></a>
I will be expanding a Wiki Site in this Repository using GitHub Pages. This will include not only how to install the GE 18xx Game Engine, but the Net Game Server, how to Play 18XX Games using the Game Engine both Hot-Seat and over the Network. This should include screenshots with at least one sample game included. The Wiki will also describe not only existing features, but future features, and features that will NOT be implemented with explanations (justifications) as to why not.

# How to Contribute
<a name="Contribute"></a>

Interested contributors should start with examining the XSD Schemas, the DTDs, as well as the various XML Data Files.
Also examination of the Wiki Site to expand the tutorial on how to use the Game Engine and the Network Game Server.

# Tests
<a name="Tests"></a>
Routines to perform XML Lint Tests, Schema Validations, and DTD Validations on the XML Files need to be expanded and automated.
No Updates should be posted that don't pass these tests, whether it is an update to the XML, the XSD, or the DTDs.
