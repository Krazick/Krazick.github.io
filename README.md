18XX Game Engine - XSD Files for XML Game Files

# Wiki Site
I will be expanding a Wiki Site in this Repository using GitHub Pages. This will include not only how to install the GE 18xx Game Engine, but the Net Game Server, how to Play 18XX Games using the Game Engine both Hot-Seat and over the Network. This should include screenshots with at least one sample game included. The Wiki will also describe not only existing features, but future features, and features that will NOT be implemented with explanations (justifications) as to why not.
